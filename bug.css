The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an issue where the `::before` pseudo-element's content overlaps the main element's content unexpectedly.  This can happen if the `position` property isn't handled carefully, particularly when using absolute or relative positioning within containers with specific dimensions. 

```css
div {
  width: 200px;
  height: 100px;
  background-color: lightblue;
  position: relative; /* important for ::before to be positioned relatively to this div */
}

div::before {
  content: "Before";
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  background-color: lightcoral;
  padding: 10px;
}
```

The `::before` element, despite its intended position at the top-left, will visually overlap the `div`'s background, potentially obscuring parts of its content or leading to unexpected visual rendering.
